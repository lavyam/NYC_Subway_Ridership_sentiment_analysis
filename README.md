// Introduction 

The New York City subway system is one of the largest, most popular and complex public transit networks in the world. It serves thousands if not millions of commuters each day. It is very well known for its efficiency and connectivity, but is also notoriously famous for its delays and safety concerns on a daily basis. In the era of social media, there is a lot of conversation about how the public feels about the MTA. 

This paper explores the relationship between social media discourse and overall ridership trends in New York City, aiming to understand if social media discourse, particularly the top posts about the MTA everyday tend to affect the subway ridership. In a sentence, the paper aims to answer the question, “ Does public perception, as reflected on social media, influence how people move through the city?” 

We find that there is a consistent negative effect on ridership in the aftermath of high-volume and high-polarity discourse. We also find that this negative effect is seen across different areas in the city, and even across all five boroughs. 

Detailed Analysis can be found in the final paper uploaded.
